# Zog


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lyjia/zog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lyjia/zog) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Zog is an advanced, multi-logging library for Ruby with a simple interface.

You can log to Zog through a globally-available `Zog` module, or manually instantiate multiple instances of `Zog` for whatever logging usage you see fit. While `Zog` instances are designed to be a drop-in replacement for Ruby's stdlib's `Logger` class, they extend `Logger`'s featureset with support for:
 * Unlimited outputs of multiple types:
    * File logger
    * `STDOUT`/`STDERR`/`IO`/`StringIO` stream logger
 * Advanced log message formatting support (color, bold, and more)
 * Caller identification within the log message

`Zog` makes debugging and monitoring your code a breeze!

Note that version 0.5 is currently ***in development***, do not use this in production code!
    

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'zog'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zog

## Usage (for 0.5)

### Quick Tour

In it's default configuration, `Zog` can be accessed from its global singleton, like so:

    Zog.debug("Hello world!")
    
This will produce the following output on-screen (in STDERR):

    20190101-120000 debug in irb_binding(): Hello world!
    
And the following output in `./log/zog.log`:

    D, [2019-01-01T12:00:00.000000 #0000] DEBUG -- irb_binding: Hello world!
    
To try this out, install `Zog` and load up an IRB console: 

	irb(main):> require 'zog'
	=> true

	irb(main):> Zog.debug("Hello")
    20190101-120000 debug in irb_binding(): Hello
    => nil
	
	irb(main):> Zog.error("Oh no! Something went wrong!")
    20190101-120001 error in irb_binding(): Oh no! Something went wrong!
    => nil
	
You can instantiate new `Zog` instances like so:

    irb(main):> z = Zog.new
    => #<Zog::Heart [...]>
    irb(main):> z.info("Hello from a separate instance!")
    20190101-120002 info in irb_binding(): Hello from a separate instance!
    => nil



#### Available Channels

`Zog` includes all the Ruby `stdlib` channels (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`, and `unknown`) plus an `other` channel and a `_zog_internal` channel (disabled by default). Zog outputs can have separate channel configurations within a single `Zog` instance.
